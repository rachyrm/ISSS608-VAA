Notably, female students exhibit stronger performance in Reading, while male students demonstrate higher scores in Mathematics and Science. Despite these differences, the means and medians for each subject appear to be similar between both genders. Additionally, there is a noticeable presence of outliers, especially towards the lower scores, which indicates below-average performances."

However, room status may not be a decisive indicator for academic scores, as the differences observed are relatively modest. It is important to note that there are substantial outliers among the dataset, indicating a diverse range of academic outcomes within this group. This suggests that while room ownership may play a role, it is not the sole determinant of performance, and other factors may contribute to the student scores.\n\n\nEducational platforms\nAccess to educational platforms can be a marker of socioeconomic welfare, reflecting an investment in learning resources. These platforms help people keep learning and gaining new skills. Having them at home does not only show a commitment to progress, but it also shows the capability of a household to put in extra, even when not needed.\n\nMathematicsReadingScience\n\n\n\n\nShow code\nmath_app &lt;- ggplot(data = stu_data_edu_app,\n       aes(x = as.factor(Edu_App),\n           y = Math_Score)) +\n  geom_boxplot(color = \"grey50\",\n               fill = \"#ADD0B3\") +\n  geom_point(stat = \"summary\",\n             fun.y = \"mean\",\n             colour = \"#137a63\",\n             size = 3) +\n  ylim(0, 1000) +\n  labs(x = \"Educational App\",\n       y = \"\",\n       title = \"Mathematics\",\n       axis.title.y = element_blank())\nmath_app\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow code\nreading_app &lt;- ggplot(data = stu_data_edu_app,\n       aes(x = as.factor(Edu_App),\n           y = Reading_Score)) +\n  geom_boxplot(color = \"grey50\",\n               fill = \"#ADD0B3\") +\n  geom_point(stat = \"summary\",\n             fun.y = \"mean\",\n             colour = \"#137a63\",\n             size = 3) +\n  ylim(0, 1000) +\n  labs(x = \"Educational App\",\n       y = \"\",\n       title = \"Reading\",\n       axis.title.y = element_blank())\nreading_app\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow code\nscience_app &lt;- ggplot(data = stu_data_edu_app,\n       aes(x = as.factor(Edu_App),\n           y = Science_Score)) +\n  geom_boxplot(color = \"grey50\",\n               fill = \"#ADD0B3\") +\n  geom_point(stat = \"summary\",\n             fun.y = \"mean\",\n             colour = \"#137a63\",\n             size = 3) +\n  ylim(0, 1000) +\n  labs(x = \"Educational App\",\n       y = \"\",\n       title = \"Science\",\n       axis.title.y = element_blank())\nscience_app\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow code\nmath_app + reading_app + science_app\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalyzing the relationship between the use of educational platforms and student performance, the findings indicate that individuals with educational platforms tend to achieve higher average scores compared to those who don’t utilize such resources.

Despite this dispersion, a consistent pattern emerges, with correlation coefficients indicating a medium positive relationship between socioeconomic status and academic performance. Specifically, the correlation coefficient of approximately 0.41~0.42 suggests that as students exhibit higher socioeconomic standing, a corresponding increase in their academic scores is observed. This highlights a noticable association between socioeconomic factors and students’ academic achievements.\n\n\nArtworks\nThe presence of paintings and sculptures at home can show how well-off a family is.

In some cases, other htmlwidgets will respect these options, such as persistent selection in leaflet.\nbscols() is a helper function of crosstalk package. It makes it easy to put HTML elements side by side. It can be called directly from the console but is especially designed to work in an R Markdown document.

Scores”, and a y-axis label for “Score”.\nThe notch that narrows the box around the median also seems to be unnecessary as it is too difficult to determine the exact value of it just by looking at it.\nWhile a boxplot provides a concise visual summary of the distribution including outliers, I believe that a histogram is preferred since its able to present an overall trend more intuitively with a detailed view of the entire spread of the data, while providing statistical information for readers to easily grasp.\nA disadvantage of a boxplot is that it doesn’t show individual data points, thus each observation is assumed to be equal and symmetrical in the distribution.\n\n\n\nAesthetics\n\nColors could be added to make it more visually pleasing.\nOverall graph is generally simple and clear,

To do so, patchwork can be implemented for readers to easily visualize and read.\n\n\n\nThe overall look of the boxplot is neat, with labels. However, after the patchwork, the title labels only needs the subject, with “Scores” as a y-axis label.\nThe use of the notch can be confusing for readers who are not familar to the idea of it representing the median. It might be overwhelming, thus it would be better to disregard this in the boxplots.\n\n\n\nAesthetics\n\nOther than the mean point, there are no colors are present. Since the previous histogram was filled with a light blue color, I will do the same here to make it more appealing.\nThe maroon color does not seem to match the color scheme of the website, so this will be replaced with dark blue.\nThe size of the outliers are too big, resulting in a clustered appearance, so this will be adjusted.\n\n\n\n\nSketch for Alternative Design\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMakeover\n\n\nShow the code\nmath &lt;- ggplot(data = stu_qqq_SG_filtered,\n       aes(x = Gender, y = MATH_Score)) +\n  geom_boxplot(fill = \"lightblue\", color = \"black\", outlier.size = 1) +\n  stat_summary(geom = \"point\", fun.y = \"mean\", color = \"darkblue\", size = 2) +\n  ggtitle(\"Mathematics\") +\n  ylab(\"Scores\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(100, 900)) +\n  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(100, 900, by = 100)) +\n  labs(x = \"\", y = \"Score\", title = \"Mathematics\", axis.title.y = element_blank())\n\nread &lt;- ggplot(data = stu_qqq_SG_filtered,\n       aes(x = Gender, y = READ_Score)) +\n  geom_boxplot(fill = \"lightblue\", color = \"black\", outlier.size = 1) +\n  stat_summary(geom = \"point\", fun.y = \"mean\", color = \"darkblue\", size = 2) +\n  ggtitle(\"Reading\") +\n  xlab(\"Gender\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(100, 900)) +\n  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(100, 900, by = 100)) +\n  theme(axis.text.y = element_blank(), axis.title.y = element_blank())\n\nsci &lt;- ggplot(data = stu_qqq_SG_filtered,\n       aes(x = Gender, y = SCIE_Score)) +\n  geom_boxplot(fill = \"lightblue\", color = \"black\", outlier.size = 1) +\n  stat_summary(geom = \"point\", fun.y = \"mean\", color = \"darkblue\", size = 2) +\n  ggtitle(\"Science\") +\n  ylab(\"Scores\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(100, 900)) +\n  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(100, 900, by = 100)) +\n  theme(axis.title.x = element_blank(), axis.text.y = element_blank(), axis.title.y = element_blank())\n\nmath + read + sci"

    "text": "Correlation coefficient is a popular statistic that use to measure the type and strength of the relationship between two variables. The values of a correlation coefficient ranges between -1.0 and 1.0. A correlation coefficient of 1 shows a perfect linear relationship between the two variables, while a -1.0 shows a perfect inverse relationship between the two variables. A correlation coefficient of 0.0 shows no linear relationship between the two variables.\nWhen multivariate data are used, the correlation coefficeints of the pair comparisons are displayed in a table form known as correlation matrix or scatterplot matrix.\nThere are three broad reasons for computing a correlation matrix.\n\nTo reveal the relationship between high-dimensional variables pair-wisely.\nTo input into other analyses. For example, people commonly use correlation matrices as inputs for exploratory factor analysis, confirmatory factor analysis, structural equation models, and linear regression when excluding missing values pairwise.\nAs a diagnostic when checking other analyses. For example, with linear regression a high amount of correlations suggests that the linear regression’s estimates will be unreliable.\n\nWhen the data is large, both in terms of the number of observations and the number of variables, Corrgram tend to be used to visually explore and analyse the structure and the patterns of relations among variables. It is designed based on two main schemes:\n\nRendering the value of a correlation to depict its sign and magnitude, and\nReordering the variables in a correlation matrix so that “similar” variables are positioned adjacently, facilitating perception.\n\nIn this hands-on exercise, I will be learning how to plot data visualisation for visualising correlation matrix with R. It consists of three main sections. First, I will learn how to create correlation matrix using pairs() of R Graphics. Next, I will learn how to plot corrgram using corrplot package of R.

In general, these variables’ values have their own range. In order to ensure that all the variables have comparable values, data transformation are commonly used before clustering.\nThree main data transformation methods are supported by heatmaply(), namely: scale, normalise and percentilse.\n\nScaling method\n\nWhen all variables are came from or assumed to come from some normal distribution, then scaling (i.e.: subtract the mean and divide by the standard deviation) would bring them all close to the standard normal distribution.\nIn such a case, each value would reflect the distance from the mean in units of standard deviation.\nThe scale argument in heatmaply() supports column and row scaling.\n\nThe code chunk below is used to scale variable values columewise.\n\nheatmaply(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)],\n          scale = \"column\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNormalising method\n\nWhen variables in the data comes from possibly different (and non-normal) distributions, the normalize function can be used to bring data to the 0 to 1 scale by subtracting the minimum and dividing by the maximum of all observations.\nThis preserves the shape of each variable’s distribution while making them easily comparable on the same “scale”.\n\nDifferent from Scaling, the normalise method is performed on the input data set i.e. wh_matrix as shown in the code chunk below.\n\nheatmaply(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPercentising method\n\nThis is similar to ranking the variables, but instead of keeping the rank values, divide them by the maximal rank.\nThis is done by using the ecdf of the variables on their own values, bringing each value to its empirical percentile.\nThe benefit of the percentize function is that each value has a relatively clear interpretation, it is the percent of observations that got that value or below it.\n\nSimilar to Normalize method, the Percentize method is also performed on the input data set i.e. wh_matrix as shown in the code chunk below.\n\nheatmaply(percentize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]))"

    "text": "Seriation\nOne of the problems with hierarchical clustering is that it doesn’t actually place the rows in a definite order, it merely constrains the space of possible orderings. Take three items A, B and C. If you ignore reflections, there are three possible orderings: ABC, ACB, BAC. If clustering them gives you ((A+B)+C) as a tree, you know that C can’t end up between A and B, but it doesn’t tell you which way to flip the A+B cluster. It doesn’t tell you if the ABC ordering will lead to a clearer-looking heatmap than the BAC ordering.\nheatmaply uses the seriation package to find an optimal ordering of rows and columns. Optimal means to optimize the Hamiltonian path length that is restricted by the dendrogram structure. This, in other words, means to rotate the branches so that the sum of distances between each adjacent leaf (label) will be minimized. This is related to a restricted version of the travelling salesman problem.\nHere we meet our first seriation algorithm: Optimal Leaf Ordering (OLO). This algorithm starts with the output of an agglomerative clustering algorithm and produces a unique ordering, one that flips the various branches of the dendrogram around so as to minimize the sum of dissimilarities between adjacent leaves. Here is the result of applying Optimal Leaf Ordering to the same clustering result as the heatmap above.\n\nheatmaply(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]),\n          seriate = \"OLO\")\n\n\n\n\n\nThe default options is “OLO” (Optimal leaf ordering) which optimizes the above criterion (in O(n^4)).

It is ideal for comparing multiple variables together and seeing the relationships between them. For example, the variables contribute to Happiness Index. Parallel coordinates was invented by Alfred Inselberg in the 1970s as a way to visualize high-dimensional data. This data visualisation technique is more often found in academic and scientific communities than in business and consumer data visualizations. As pointed out by Stephen Few(2006), “This certainly isn’t a chart that you would present to the board of directors or place on your Web site for the general public. In fact, the strength of parallel coordinates isn’t in their ability to communicate some truth in the data to others, but rather in their ability to bring meaningful multivariate patterns and comparisons to light when used interactively for analysis.” For example, parallel coordinates plot can be used to characterise clusters detected during customer segmentation.\nThe learning objectives of this exercise include:\n\nplotting statistic parallel coordinates plots by using ggparcoord() of GGally package,\nplotting interactive parallel coordinates plots by using parcoords package, and\nplotting interactive parallel coordinates plots by using parallelPlot package."

When you then apply the verbs above on the resulting object they’ll be automatically applied “by group”.\nGrouping affects the verbs as follows:\n\ngrouped select() is the same as ungrouped select(), except that grouping variables are always retained.\ngrouped arrange() is the same as ungrouped; unless you set .by_group = TRUE, in which case it orders first by the grouping variables.\nmutate() and filter() are most useful in conjunction with window functions (like rank(), or min(x) == x). They are described in detail in vignette(“window-functions”).\nsample_n() and sample_frac() sample the specified number/fraction of rows in each group.\nsummarise() computes the summary for each group.\n\nIn our case, group_by() will used together with summarise() to derive the summarised data.frame.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommendation\n\n\n\nThose who are new to dplyr methods should consult Introduction to dplyr before moving on to the next section."

    "text": "Data classification methods of tmap\nMost choropleth maps employ some methods of data classification. The point of classification is to take a large number of observations and group them into data ranges or classes.\ntmap provides a total ten data classification methods, namely: fixed, sd, equal, pretty (default), quantile, kmeans, hclust, bclust, fisher, and jenks.\nTo define a data classification method, the style argument of tm_fill() or tm_polygons() will be used.\n\nPlotting choropleth maps with built-in classification methods\nThe code chunk below shows a quantile data classification that used 5 classes.\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+\n  tm_fill(\"DEPENDENCY\",\n          n = 5,\n          style = \"jenks\") +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5)\n\n\n\n\nIn the code chunk below, equal data classification method is used.\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+\n  tm_fill(\"DEPENDENCY\",\n          n = 5,\n          style = \"equal\") +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5)\n\n\n\n\nNotice that the distribution of quantile data classification method are more evenly distributed then equal data classification method.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning!\n\n\n\nMaps Lie!\n\n\n\nDIY: Using what you had learned, prepare choropleth maps by using different classification methods supported by tmap and compare their differences.\n\n\nDIY: Preparing choropleth maps by using similar classification method but with different numbers of classes (i.e. 2, 6, 10, 20). Compare the output maps, what observation can you draw?\n\n\n\nPlotting choropleth map with custome break\nFor all the built-in styles, the category breaks are computed internally. In order to override these defaults, the breakpoints can be set explicitly by means of the breaks argument to the tm_fill(). It is important to note that, in tmap the breaks include a minimum and maximum. As a result, in order to end up with n categories, n+1 elements must be specified in the breaks option (the values must be in increasing order).\nBefore we get started, it is always a good practice to get some descriptive statistics on the variable before setting the break points. Code chunk below will be used to compute and display the descriptive statistics of DEPENDENCY field.\n\nsummary(mpsz_pop2020$DEPENDENCY)\n\n   Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max.    NA's \n 0.1111  0.7147  0.7866  0.8585  0.8763 19.0000      92 \n\n\nWith reference to the results above, we set break point at 0.60, 0.70, 0.80, and 0.90. In addition, we also need to include a minimum and maximum, which we set at 0 and 100. Our breaks vector is thus c(0, 0.60, 0.70, 0.80, 0.90, 1.00)\nNow, we will plot the choropleth map by using the code chunk below.\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+\n  tm_fill(\"DEPENDENCY\",\n          breaks = c(0, 0.60, 0.70, 0.80, 0.90, 1.00)) +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5)"
